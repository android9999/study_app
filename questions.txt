Front: Wavelength formula (\( n\lambda \)) ; Back: \( = 2πr \) (6.7)  Comment: Relates the wavelength of an electron's de Broglie wave to its orbital radius.
Front: Orbital radius (\( r \)) ; Back: \( = \frac{n\lambda}{2π} \) (6.8)  Comment: Represents the radius of an electron's orbit in terms of its de Broglie wavelength.
Front: Angular momentum (\( L \)) ; Back: \( = mvr = pr = nh \) (6.9)  Comment: Angular momentum of a particle in terms of its mass, velocity, momentum, and Planck's constant.
Front: Bohr radius (\( r \)) ; Back: \( = a_0 n^2 \) (6.10)  Comment: Represents the average distance of the electron from the nucleus in a hydrogen-like atom, where \( a_0 \) is the Bohr radius and \( n \) is the principal quantum number.
